        My research primarily dwells in the intersection of LGBTQ+ rights, racial inequality, and child neglection.
        
        By employing a range of computational methods and techniques, I seek to shed light on pressing social issues of our time by applying data science to these areas, I aim to bring about a more nuanced, data-driven approach to social justice and human rights.
