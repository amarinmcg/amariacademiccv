This project that demonstrates my skills in data manipulation and analysis using Python. The project involved cleaning, processing and analyzing a large dataset from a survey. I used various Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for statistical modeling. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from the survey data to guide decision-making. This project showcases my ability to handle large datasets and apply appropriate statistical methods to derive valuable insights.
